## 2024.4.10 Due to suno official update, some of the project features are not available, and have been re-changed. Projects that were pulled before 2024/4/10:15:04, please pull them again. docker will be updated later (already updated, please pay attention to the pulled version number when pulling them.)

## ‚ú® Project features
- **OpenAI format call**: support for streaming output content.
- **Front-end compatibility**: adapt `chat-next-web` and other front-end projects.
- **Docker deployment**: simplify the deployment process, support `docker-compose`, `docker`.
- **Multi-cookie management**: enables polling of multiple cookies for use.

## üöÄ Follow-up plans
- Introduce request queue wait optimization.
- Support for custom parameters (e.g. `tags`, `prompt`, `style` and continuation of songs).
- Explore the development of a front-end page similar to the official website.

## ü´ô Docker Deployment

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to run a Docker container using specific environment variables and port mapping. For the purposes of this guide, sensitive information such as SQL names, passwords, and IP addresses will be replaced with placeholders.

## Prerequisites

- You have Docker installed on your machine.
- You have basic knowledge of the Docker command line interface.

## Procedure

1. **Pulling a Docker image**

   First, make sure you have the Docker image `wlhtea/suno2openai:latest` on your machine. If not, you can pull it from the Docker repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker pull wlhtea/suno2openai:0.0.2
   ```

2. **Running a Docker container**

   Run the Docker container with the necessary environment variables and port mapping. Replace `<SQL_NAME>`, `<SQL_PASSWORD>` and `<DB_HOST>` with the actual values of your SQL database connection. These values should be kept private and not shared publicly.

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name suno2openai \
      -p 8000:8000 \
      -e DB_USER='<DB_USER>' \
      -e DB_PASSWORD='<DB_PASSWORD>' \
      -e DB_HOST='<DB_HOST>' \
      -e DB_PORT=3306 \
      --restart=always \
      k8scat/suno2openai:latest
   ```

   **Parameter description:**
   - `-d`: Run the container in background mode and print the container ID.
   - `-p 8000:8000`: Maps the container's port 8000 to the host's port 8000.
   - `-e`: Set environment variables for your container.
   - `--restart=always`: Ensure that the container is always restarted, unless stopped manually.

3. **Add a cookie to the database
   Just open the database and add a cookie count is the number of times remaining (an auto-import will be added later)
   ```mysql
   id = int
   cookie = Cookie
   count = int
   working = 0
   ```

Database may report error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items', [check for correctness here](https://github.com/wlhtea/Suno2openai/issues/10)

5. **Access to applications**

   Once the container is running, the application inside it should be accessible on port 8000 via `http://localhost:8000` or the IP address of your Docker host.

## Caution.

Before running the Docker container, make sure you replace placeholders such as `<DB_USER>`, `<DB_PASSWORD>` and `<DB_HOST>` with their actual values.

## üì¶ docker-compose deployment
_Updated: 2024/4/7 18:18_

### Clone the project to the server
```bash
git clone https://github.com/k8scat/Suno2openai.git
```

### Create a database
Create a database (with any name you want), remember to save the password and make sure the database permissions are set correctly (Allow all IPs to connect or Docker container IPs only).

### Configure environment variables in compose file

### Enter the project directory
```bash
cd Suno2openai
```

### Update cookies
Edit the ``update_cookie_to_sql.py`` file and fill the array below with your cookies:
```python
cookies = ['cookie1', 'cookie2']
```
! [cookie location example](https://github.com/wlhtea/Suno2openai/assets/115779315/6edf9969-9eb6-420f-bfcd-dbf4b282ecbf)

### Start Docker
```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up
```
## **Notes**:
- **Security group configuration**: make sure port 8000 is open.
- **HTTPS support**: If the front-end project uses HTTPS, the reverse proxy URL for this project should also use HTTPS.

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions
- Calling sunoapi directly in `chat-next-web` with the deployment url works, but not via `new-api`. You may need to check the source code of `new-api`.

## üîå Accessing new-api(one-api)
Fill in the address of this project in the proxy settings of the channel in the format: `http://<server IP>:8000`. It is recommended to use HTTPS and domain name.
