# Suno2openai
> Integrated based on [SunoSongsCreator](https://github.com/yihong0618/SunoSongsCreator) and [Suno-API](https://github.com/SunoAI-API/Suno-API) projects, offering standardized service interfaces compliant with OpenAI formats.

## Changelog
- 2024.4.14 Support for non-streaming output with `stream=False` docker version 0.1.1 No need to update if you don't need this feature.
- 2024.4.14 Updated a script to automatically retrieve cookies from registered Outlook emails and write them into the database.
- 2024.4.12 **Completed integration of new-api and one-api**, select OpenAI calls, and input the project deployment address (no need for /v1/); the key can be left empty.
- 2024.4.10 Due to Suno's official updates, some project features were inoperable, now modified. Please re-pull the projects pulled before 2024/4/10 15:04; Docker to be updated later (already updated, be mindful of the version number when pulling).

## ‚ú® Project Highlights
- **OpenAI Format Calls**: Supports streaming output.
- **Front-end Compatibility**: Compatible with front-end projects like `chat-next-web`.
- **Docker Deployment**: Simplifies deployment process, supports `docker-compose`, `docker`.
- **Multiple Cookie Management**: Implements rotation of multiple cookies.

## üöÄ Future Plans
- Introduce request queueing optimizations.
- Support for custom parameters (such as `tags`, `prompt`, `style`, and song continuation).
- Explore development of official-like frontend pages.
- Welcome valuable suggestions! üìß **Email**: 1544007699@qq.com

## ü´ô Docker Deployment

This tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on running a Docker container with specific environment variables and port mappings. For the purpose of this guide, sensitive information such as SQL names, passwords, and IP addresses will be replaced with placeholders.

## Prerequisites

- Docker is installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Docker CLI.

## Steps

1. **Pull Docker Image**

   Ensure the Docker image `wlhtea/suno2openai:0.1.1` is available on your machine. If not, you can pull it from the Docker repository using:

   ```bash
   docker pull wlhtea/suno2openai:0.1.1
   ```

2. **Run Docker Container**

   Run the Docker container using necessary environment variables and port mappings. Replace `<SQL_NAME>`, `<SQL_PASSWORD>`, and `<DB_HOST>` with your actual SQL database connection values. These should be kept confidential and not shared publicly.

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name wsunoapi \
   -p 8000:8000 \
   -e BASE_URL='https://studio-api.suno.ai' \
   -e SESSION_ID='<your-session-id not required>' \
   -e DB_USER='<SQL_NAME>' \
   -e DB_PASSWORD='<SQL_PASSWORD>' \
   -e DB_HOST='<DB_HOST>' \
   -e DB_PORT=3306 \
   --restart=always \
   wlhtea/suno2openai:0.1.1
   ```

   **Parameter Explanation:**
   - `-d`: Run the container in detached mode and print the container ID.
   - `--name wsunoapi`: Name your container `wsunoapi` for easy reference.
   - `-p 8000:8000`: Map the container's 8000 port to the host machine's 8000 port.
   - `-e`: Set environment variables for your container.
   - `--restart=always`: Ensure the container always restarts, unless manually stopped.

3. **Add Cookie to Database**
   Simply open the database and add cookies with the remaining count (an automatic import feature will be added later).
   ```mysql
   id = int
   cookie = Cookie
   count = int
   working = 0
   ```

Database may report error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items', [check here if correct](https://github.com/wlhtea/Suno2openai/issues/10)

5. **Access the Application**

   Once the container is running, the application inside should be accessible via `http://localhost:8000` or the 8000 port of your Docker host machine's IP address.

## Note

Before running the Docker container, make sure you replace placeholders like `<SQL_NAME>`, `<SQL_PASSWORD>`, `<DB_HOST>`, and `<your-session-id>` with actual values.
## üì¶ Docker-Compose Deployment
_Update Time: 2024/4/7 18:18_

### Clone the Project to Your Server
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wlhtea/Suno2openai.git
```

### Create a Database
Create a database (name it as you wish), remember to save the password, and ensure the database permissions are set correctly (allow connections from all IPs or only from Docker container IPs).

### Configure Environment Variables
**Rename the `env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the corresponding details:**
```plaintext
BASE_URL=https://studio-api.suno.ai
SESSION_ID=cookie # This item does not need to be changed
DB_USER=<Database Name>
DB_PASSWORD=<Database Password>
DB_HOST=<Database Host IP>
DB_PORT=3306 # Database port
```

### Enter the Project Directory
```bash
cd Suno2openai
```

### Update Cookie


### Start Docker
```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up
```
**Notes**:
- **Security Group Configuration**: Ensure the port 8000 is open.
- **HTTPS Support**: If the frontend project uses HTTPS, the proxy URL of this project should also use HTTPS.

## üç™ Obtaining Cookies
### For Personal Use
Edit the `update_cookie_to_sql.py` file and insert your cookies into the array below:
```python
cookies = ['cookie1', 'cookie2']
```
![Example of Cookie Location](https://github.com/wlhtea/Suno2openai/assets/115779315/6edf9969-9eb6-420f-bfcd-dbf4b282ecbf)

### For Team Use
- Obtain cookies in bulk through the [file-based program](https://github.com/wlhtea/Suno2openai/tree/main/suno_%E6%89%93%E5%8F%B7%E5%8F%96cookie).
- After obtaining, place the generated `outlook.csv` in the same directory as `sign_suno.py` to retrieve cookies.
- Paste the obtained cookies into the `update_cookie_to_sql.py` file under `cookies = [paste directly here]`.
- Run `update_cookie_to_sql.py`, provided that the environment is set up correctly, whether you are deploying in Docker or locally.

## üîå Integrating new-api(one-api)
In the channel's proxy settings, enter the project address as `http://<server IP>:8000`. HTTPS and a domain name are recommended.
